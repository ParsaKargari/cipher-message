# cipher-message
An encryption program that allows a user to encode and decode text using a specific cipher. The code defines several functions that perform different tasks as part of the encoding and decoding process, such as mapping the alphabet to a cipher, removing duplicate letters from the cipher, and outputting the encoded or decoded text.
